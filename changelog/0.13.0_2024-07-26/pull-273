Change: Shut down cleanly on TERM and INT signals

Rest-server now listens for TERM and INT signals and cleanly closes down the
http.Server and listener when receiving either of them.

This is particularly useful when listening on a unix socket, as the server
will now remove the socket file when it shuts down.
