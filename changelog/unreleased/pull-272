Enhancement: Support listening on a unix socket

To let rest-server listen on a unix socket, prefix the socket filename with `unix:` and pass it to the `--listen` option, for example `--listen unix:/tmp/foo`.

This is useful in combination with remote port forwarding to enable remote server to backup locally, e.g.

```
rest-server --listen unix:/tmp/foo &
ssh -R /tmp/foo:/tmp/foo user@host restic -r rest:http+unix:///tmp/foo:/repo backup
```
